# Earthquake Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict earthquake occurrences based on historical seismic data. It aims to identify patterns in earthquake parameters such as magnitude, depth, time, and location to forecast the likelihood of future seismic events in specific regions.

## 🌍 Project Overview

Earthquake prediction is a challenging but critical task in disaster management. While it’s not currently possible to predict exact times and magnitudes with high accuracy, machine learning can help assess seismic risks and identify high-risk zones based on trends in geophysical data.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Real-world dataset from USGS and other public seismic data repositories.
- 🧠 Multiple machine learning models tested: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost.
- 📈 Data visualization: Heatmaps, scatter plots, and temporal distribution.
- 🗺️ Geospatial mapping of seismic zones using optional tools like Folium.
- 📚 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden patterns.
